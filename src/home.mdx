# TS Shared Components Library

## Install

```
yarn add ts-react-shared-components
```

> *Note*: the name `ts-react-shared-components` is an example and doesn't exist on NPM. If you are on the nexus registry (nexus.csp-ts.com), try installing `shared-components-poc`.

## Dependencies

To use this library, you'll need to have the font-awesome and Lato fonts loaded.
You can add the following to your app's index.html:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.4.1/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-5sAR7xN1Nv6T6+dT2mhtzEpVJvfS3NScPQTrOxhwjIuvcA67KV2R5Jz6kr4abQsz" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Global styles

This library comes with a few global styles, that are optional.
If you want to use them, at the root of your application, add the following component:

> *Note*: Having Global styles is debatable, I will add a section on this on the Wiki/Google docs discussion

```
import { GlobalStyles } from "ts-react-shared-components";

[...]

<GlobalStyles />
```
